# RedisRails

I'm using this repository to teach myself how to use Redis in a Rails environment.  

* Ruby version - 2.3.0

* System dependencies
1. Please [Download Redis](https://redis.io/)

* Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/githubacct54385/RedisRails.git
$ cd RedisRails
```

* Install gems
```
$ bundle install
```

* Now it's time to start your Redis Server.  Open a new terminal and use this command:
```
$ redis server
```

* In your first terminal, start the Rails server using
```
$ rails s
```

* Deployment instructions
...These are forthcoming
