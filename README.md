# RedisRails

I'm using this repository to teach myself how to use Redis in a Rails environment.  

* Ruby version - 2.3.0

Things you will need to get started with this repo:
1. [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
2. [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
3. Redis - Instructions (for Mac) on how to install Redis can be found [here](https://medium.com/@petehouston/install-and-config-redis-on-mac-os-x-via-homebrew-eb8df9a4f298)

If you don't have Redis on your machine, please download it [here](https://redis.io/)

* Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/githubacct54385/RedisRails.git
$ cd RedisRails
```

* Install gems
```
$ bundle install
```

* Now it's time to start your Redis Server.  Open a new terminal and use this command:
```
$ redis server
```

* In your first terminal, start the Rails server using
```
$ rails s
```

* Deployment instructions
